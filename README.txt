In this project, you play as a fire wizard (who can't walk apparently) looking to learn the secrets of the scorpion king. To move 
around you can press the touchpad of your left joystick to teleport around. 

After finding his lair, you realise you don't have enough magic power to light up his pyre (4 of them on top of the purple pillars) 
to pay your respects. Fortunately you can find books around that will level up your magic power that can propel your projectiles
further. You can grab these books with your right controller and use your trigger button to grab the books at the end of the laser. 
Upon releasing the trigger, you will automatically consume them.

WIth the same controls, you can also grab vases (and set them ablaze) that will shoot out in the direction you hold them at. The higher
your powerlevel (indicated on the staff), the stronger the force that sends the vase flying. The vase will ignite the brazier on contact.
To check how many braziers you will need to light up, you can check the candles lit on the spawn area. Finally once all braziers are lit,
the cup in the middle will release a gem which you can then grab to bring to the statue of the scorpion king. 

Upon placing the gem, you will be treated to a nice surprise :)
